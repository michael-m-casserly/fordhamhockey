<p>The university supports hockey as a club sport. The team was created in the 1967–68 season playing and winning one game versus cross-town rival Manhattan College. The "Maroon Six" as they were known then, began playing a full slate of games during the 1970–71 season. The team joined the Metropolitan Intercollegiate Hockey League, in the fall of 1970 and began playing such teams as Columbia, Fairfield and St. Johns. Since then the team has held the longest tenure in its current league the Metropolitan Collegiate Hockey Conference (MCHC) after the MIHL changed its name during the 1974–75 season. In 2010, the Rams captured their second league championship, the teams first was in 2005–06. In 2011, the team lost in the Championship game to longtime rival Wagner College. The team also is a member of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) which ranks club teams on a national basis.</p>

<p>The team begins its practices early September skating twice a week until the 16 game league schedule kicks off mid-October. Once the league games start, the practices are scaled back to once a week. No games are played during Thanksgiving break, finals week in December or Christmas break. The season culminates with first round of playoffs in the second weekend of February and the semi finals and finals the third weekend in February. The season is concluded with the annual alumni game, which was reinstated recently after a 5-year absence.</p>
