<p>Sep 14, 2010 -- This past weekend the 2010-11 version of the Fordham Hockey team began their defense of their Metropolitan Collegiate Hockey Conference championship crown.</p>

<p>Competing in the Aston Pennsylvania Ice Works College Club tournament, this past weekend marked the earliest the team has ever skated in a game situation to start their season.  The tournament guaranteed three game slots with a possible fourth slot for a championship game. It would serve as a turn up for the teams regular league schedule which does not start until October 8.</p>

<p>With only 2 team practices/tryouts under their belt, things were rough from the onset.</p>

<p>The team graduated their entire first line of offense from last year's championship team, which last year accounted for 45% of the team's goal production. To add insult to injury, of the remaining 16 returning players from the championship squad, 6 decided to either focus on academics or internships and decided not play come out and play.  That left the team with a crop of new players as well as the remaining returnees, but even then, some of these players couldn't make the tournament because of outside obligations.</p>

<p>So the depleted Rams squad traveled to PA with 2 goalies, 4 defensemen, 7 forwards and minimal expectations...<i><b>and made it all the way to the championship game</b></i>.</p>

<p>The team defeated Shippensburg by a 6-2 margin on Friday @ 7:00 pm, then played twice on Saturday defeating Neumann 5-4 @ 9:00 am and Bucknell 4-2 @ 5:00 pm.</p>

<p>The team fell to Salisbury by a 4-1 mark in the championship game @ 2:00 pm Sunday.</p>

<p>Though the team does not skate another game until 10/1 against old nemesis Wagner College, things seem to look promising based off of this weekend's past results.</p>

<p>Our schedule for the remainder of the year should be ready by the end of the week and hopefully will be posted to the web.</p>
