<div class="NewsArticleTitle">Fordham Looking Forward to Their 45th Season</div>
<div class="NewsArticleAuthor">By Drew Mola / Fordham Hockey Online</div></p>

<p>April, 2014 -- The 2014-2015 season sees the Fordham University ice hockey program now entering its 45th campaign, one of the longest of any the clubs at school. The team was actually created in the 1967-68 season playing and winning one game versus cross-town rival Manhattan College. The "Maroon Six" as they were known then, began playing a full slate of games during the 1970-71 seasons. The team joined the MIHL (Metropolitan Intercollegiate Hockey League), in the fall of 1970 and began playing such teams as Columbia, Fairfield and St. Johns. The team was originally created and funded by Fordham University athletics to become a varsity program. However the team was relegated to its current club status in 1975 when the school chose to elevate its club football team back to varsity instead. After a league name change to the BSMIHL (Bi-State Metropolitan Intercollegiate Hockey League) for the 1975-76 season, the team held the longest tenure as a member of the MCHC (Metropolitan Collegiate Hockey Conference) after the league changed its name at the start the of the 1976-77 season.</p>

<p>The team is coached by Rich Guberti, who begins his seventh year with the team. The team has gone 100-38-2-1 during this time.  They have finished the regular season in 1st place 3 times.  The team has also gone to the finals 3 times, winning twice.  In his five years as the team's Head Coach, Guberti historically ranks 2nd in overall wins and 1st in winning percentage.  A USA Hockey Certified Level 4 Coach, he runs successful year-round Pro Player Clinics and Summer Camps.  His Westchester Select tournament teams play in AAA tournaments during the summer on the East Coast.  He has also run successful youth hockey and junior programs.  Those teams have gone on to compete for State and National titles as well as International Silver Sticks both here and in Canada.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes is Director of Hockey Operations, Andrew Mola CBA '86 (31st year) who handles the day-to-day team operations which can range from organizing transportation, finances, alumni relations, statistical analysis, scheduling, recruiting, and running game day operations. Mola also is in his sixth year serving as the President of the MCHC and has held prior MCHC Executive Board positions such as Director of Eligibility and Director of Structures.</p>

<p>The 2013-14 season was one of the most successful in team history. In addition to the team's league schedule, Fordham played 10 non-league games against outside competition which included several contests coming against the American College Hockey Association's Atlantic regions nationally ranking top 10 teams.</p>

<p>Throughout the fall, the team remained close to the top of the MCHC standings trailing only first place Columbia by mid-November. However after the team's overtime loss to the Lions, the Rams would never lose another game for the remainder of the season. The winning momentum carried the team into the post season with a semifinal win over CCM by an 8-2 margin and onto the MCHC championship game where the team would capture their 3rd league championship with a hard fought 5-4 victory over Suffolk Community College.</p>

<p>The team finished the season in first place for the 3rd time in the last 5 years and posted a league record of 12-1-0-1 with an overall record of 20-5-2-1. The team reached the post season league tournament for the 14th consecutive year and posted their 11th consecutive winning season, the longest in team history. The teams 28 games played tied the team mark for most games played in a season and the teams 20 wins tied for the most ever in a single season. Academically, the team maintained a solid 3.2 overall GPA with 3 players awarded with ACHA Academic All-America honors.</p>

<p>The team begins its practices early September skating twice a week until the 16 game league schedule kicks off mid-October. Once the league games start, the practices are scaled back to once a week. No games are played during Thanksgiving break, finals week in December or Christmas break. The season culminates with first round of playoffs in the second weekend of February and the semi finals and finals the third weekend in February. The season is concluded with the annual alumni game, which was reinstated ten years ago after a 5-year absence.</p>
