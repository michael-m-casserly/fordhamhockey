<div class="NewsArticleAuthor">By Drew Mola / Fordham Hockey Online</div></p>

<p>Sep 19, 2008 -- The 2008-2009 season sees the Fordham University ice hockey program now entering its 39th campaign, one of the longest of any the clubs at school. The team was actually created in the 1967-68 season playing and winning one game versus cross town rival Manhattan College. The "Maroon Six" as they were known then, began playing a full slate of games during the 1970-71 season. The team joined the MIHL (Metropolitan Intercollegiate Hockey League), in the fall of 1970 and began playing such teams as Columbia, Fairfield and St. Johns. The team was originally created and funded by Fordham University athletics to become a varsity program. However the team was relegated to its current club status in 1975 when the school chose to elevate its club football team back to varsity instead. After a league name change to the BSMIHL (Bi-State Metropolitan Intercollegiate Hockey League) for the 1975-76 season, the team held the longest tenure as a member of the MCHC (Metropolitan Collegiate Hockey Conference) after the league changed its name at the start the of the 1976-77 season.</p>

<p>In charge of the team is new Head Coach Tim Collins who brings his vast wealth of experience into the position. A first timer when it comes to coaching on the college level, Tim as been involved with such programs running the Westchester Mariner youth hockey program based out of Rye Playland, as well as coaching stints with  Fordham Prep, Christ the King and the NYC Empire State teams. Behind the scenes is team general manager Andrew Mola CBA '86 (25th year) who handles the day-to-day team operations.</p>

<p>The 2007- 2008 Fordham University Hockey season was a year of transition. Two years removed from their first league championship and having graduated 10 players coming into this season, not much was expected out of the team.  But despite this, the team still managed to have a winning campaign. Competitive against all their competition, the Rams finished the season with a 9-7 in league play, good enough for a third place finish in the Metropolitan Collegiate Hockey Conference's South Region. The teams 10-9 overall record marked a 5th consecutive winning season, the longest in team history. Additionally the team qualified for the league's post season tournament for the eighth year in a row.  The team was also ranked nationally by the American Collegiate Hockey Conference (ACHA) finishing 16th in the Atlantic Division for club teams. Other season highlights included Senior Matt Pangia breaking the team record for game winning goals in a career with his 13th game winner in the teams 6-4 season finale victory over Southern Connecticut State. Senior defensemen Mike Connolly ended his career with the team by playing in all 87 games during his 4 year tenure with the team. Freshman Mike Dellutri and Sophomore Conor O'Brein were both voted on to and participated in the league's annual All-Star game which was played in Albany. The team also set a new record by receiving only 232 in total penalty minutes. Not only did the team excel on the ice, they excelled academically as well. The teams overall GPA was a solid 3.3, with 7 players being named to the American Collegiate Hockey Association's All-Academic team.</p>

<p>The team begins its practices early September skating twice a week until the 16 game league schedule kicks off mid-October. Once the league games start, the practices are scaled back to once a week. No games are played during Thanksgiving break, finals week in December or Christmas break. The season culminates with first round of playoffs in the third weekend of February and the semi finals and finals the last weekend in February. The season is concluded with the annual alumni game, which was reinstated five years ago after a 5-year absence.</p>
