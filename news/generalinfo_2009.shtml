<p>Aug 6, 2009 -- The 2009-2010 season sees the Fordham University ice hockey program now entering its 40th campaign, one of the longest of any the clubs at school. The team was actually created in the 1967-68 season playing and winning one game versus cross town rival Manhattan College. The "Maroon Six" as they were known then, began playing a full slate of games during the 1970-71 season. The team joined the MIHL (Metropolitan Intercollegiate Hockey League), in the fall of 1970 and began playing such teams as Columbia, Fairfield and St. Johns. The team was originally created and funded by Fordham University athletics to become a varsity program. However the team was relegated to its current club status in 1975 when the school chose to elevate its club football team back to varsity instead. After a league name change to the BSMIHL (Bi-State Metropolitan Intercollegiate Hockey League) for the 1975-76 season, the team held the longest tenure as a member of the MCHC (Metropolitan Collegiate Hockey Conference) after the league changed its name at the start the of the 1976-77 season.</p>

<p>The team is coached by the tandem of Tim Collins and Rich Guberti, both in their second year with the team. Both Tim and Rich have a wealth of coaching experience which includes running the Westchester Mariner youth hockey program based out of Rye Playland, as well as coaching stints with both Fordham Prep, Christ the King and the NYC Empire State teams. Behind the scenes is team general manager Andrew Mola CBA '86 (26th year) who handles the day-to-day team operations.</p>

The Rams advanced to the league quarter finals before being ousted in a heartbreaking but well fought 1-0 battle versus Farmingdale State. Overall, the squad posted a winning record of 10-9-0-1, marking the teams 6th consecutive winning season, the longest in team history. The team also is a member of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) which ranks club teams on a national basis.
