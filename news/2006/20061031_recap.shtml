<p>Oct 31, 2006 -- Recap from St. Thomas and Albany State...</p>



<p><b>vs. St. Thomas</b><br>Last Wednesday night's match-up with St. Thomas was almost identical to the teams' previous meeting in the pre-season. The game was nip and tuck throughout with the both teams exchanging goals throughout. Although the Rams out shot the Trojans by almost a 2-1 margin, too many penalties could have cost Fordham the game, as they handed St. Thomas 12 power play opportunities. Fortunately, the Rams defense allowed only 1 power play goal.</p>

<p>The turning point in the game occurred in the third period when, after St.Thomas tied the game at 3-3 and Fordham a man down, the hustle of Sophomore John Gibbons paid off. Gibbons beat St. Thomas goalie Joey Kydon to a puck which was cleared down the ice to kill off the power play. Both players went after the puck, but Gibbons got there a second earlier and put both the puck and himself into the net for the go-ahead goal. This was sweet revenge as earlier in the second period Gibbons was stopped on a penalty shot attempt.</p>



<p><b>vs. Albany State</b><br>Friday night's game versus Albany State was a highly anticipated rematch of last season's MCHC final. Unfortunately, the game was stopped when there was a problem with the door which leads the zamboni on the ice. When the door was opened for the ice cut between the second and third periods, it broke off at its hinges and because of safety reasons, the game could not continue. At the time Fordham had a 2-1 lead. The team in currently in discussions with both the league and Albany State to see when the game can be resumed.</p>
