<div class="NewsArticleTitle">MCHC Round 1 Playoff Preview - Fordham vs. Suffolk</div>

<div class="NewsArticleAuthor">By Drew Mola / Fordham Hockey Online</div></p>

<p>Feb 15, 2006 -- The Fordham Rams will face off against the Stars of Suffolk Community College this Saturday afternoon (February 18) at Sports Plus in Lake Grove Long Island. Game time is 5:00. Because Fordham is the higher seed they will be the home team for this first round playoff game even though the Sports Plus arena is the home ice for Suffolk.</p>

<p>The 2 teams have met only once before this year, with Fordham coming away with a 7-0 home victory this past January 20th.  This lopsided victory by Fordham is not representative of the history between these two teams (see below). The winner of this game will face off against the winner of the Hofstra - CCM match up. That semi-final game is scheduled for an 8:15pm start next Saturday night (February 25) at The Rinx in Hauppauge, Long Island. The winner of that game will move on to the finals played on Sunday, February 26 at 3:15pm also at The Rinx.</p>
