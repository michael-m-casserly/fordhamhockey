<p>Oct 24, 2006 -- Recap from C.C.M. and Columbia...</p>



<p><b>vs. C.C.M.</b><br>In one of the lowest scoring games in recent history, the Rams scored only twice against C.C.M., but it was just enough as Goalie Joe Wichowski notched his 6 career shutout as Fordham inched past the Titans by a 2-0 verdict. The game action was fast and furious as there were a minimal amount of penalties for both teams. Senior Steve Casey opened the scoring 1:15 into the second period and Junior Matt Pangia's power play goal at the 11:21 mark of the period was all the scoring the team would amass. Wichowski stopped 32 shots on the way en route to the victory.</p>



<p><b>vs. Columbia</b><br>Last season, Columbia was one of only 4 teams to hand the team a loss. This season, the Rams looked to avenge their loss last year at the Ice House in Hackensack, New Jersey. Last year's low scoring game gave way to a much more offensive performance from both teams this past Saturday night. A tight game throughout, Columbia was able to capitalize on Fordham defensive mistakes and were able to take advantage of their power play opportunities. The game was tied 5-5 going into the third period, but the Rams played smarter hockey against a very disciplined Lions squad and walked away with a 8-6 victory. Leading the scoring with 2 goals each were Seniors Tom Scagnelli, Dave Improta, and Sophomore John Gibbons.</p>
