<div class="NewsArticleTitle">MCHC Round 2 Playoff Preview - Fordham vs. Hofstra</div>

<div class="NewsArticleAuthor">By Drew Mola / Fordham Hockey Online</div></p>

<p>Feb 21, 2006 -- The Fordham Rams will face off against the Pride of Hofstra University in the MCHC semi-final game this Saturday evening (February 25) at The Rinx in Hauppauge, Long Island. Game time is 8:15pm.</p>

<p>The 2 teams have met only once before this year, with Fordham coming away with a 6-4 home victory this past November 18th.  The Fordham - Hofstra rivalry dates all the way back to the inception of the Hofstra program back during the 1985-86 season. On February 20, 1986 the two teams played to a 7-7 tie at Mitchell Field in Hempstead. Since then Fordham and Hofstra have met 37 times, the most of any current Fordham opponent. There has been no recent consistency when these teams meet head to head (see below). The winner of this game will face off against the winner of the Albany State - Fairfield match up which will be played simultaneously in the rink next to the Fordham game. The winners of these games will meet for the MCHC championship on Sunday,February 26 at 3:15pm also at The Rinx. Neither Fordham nor Hofstra have won a league championship, however the Pride have appeared in 2 championship games 1992-93 (vs. Siena) and 2004-05 (vs. Albany State).</p>
