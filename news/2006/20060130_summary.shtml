<p>Jan 30, 2006 -- This past weekend, the Fordham Hockey Rams avenged an earlier season loss to the College of New Jersey by soundly defeating the Lions by a 9-3 verdict.</p>



<p>After trading goals midway through the first period, the Rams kicked it up a notch to close out the first period with a 3-1 lead. After trading goals again in the middle of the second period, the Rams turned up the offense led by a 4-goal performance by Sophomore Matt Pangia to win the game going away. A balanced team effort saw twelve different players scoring at least one point.</p>

<p>In the nets, all three Ram goalies saw action as each gave up 1 goal during their 20 minutes of playing time. Sophomore Joe Wichowski started the game and notched his 15th win of the season.</p>

<p>Team notes: This weekend sees the team face its toughest opponents of the year in a back-to-back situation. Friday night Fordham hosts Fairfield (12-1) in what could be the deciding game of who finishes first in the MCHC Central Division. Saturday night the team travels to MCHC defending champion Albany State (12-1) who are currently ranked number 4 in the ACHA Atlantic Division. A Fordham win could knock the Great Danes out of the ACHA regional tournament, while giving the Rams a higher seed in the upcoming MCHC playoffs...Fordham has not defeated Albany since a 9-3 win on 2/24/96 and have only a 4-15-0-1 lifetime record against them...The Rams are now 13-1 in league play, 17-2 overall.</p>
