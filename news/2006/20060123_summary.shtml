<div class="NewsArticleTitle">Fordham 7, Suffolk 0; Fordham 4, Yale 3 (OT)</div>

<p>Jan 23, 2006 -- After a one month layoff, the Fordham Hockey Rams picked up where they left off last semester, winning. This past weekend saw the Rams face off against M.C.H.C. Island Division rival Suffolk Community College and a non-league match up with Yale.</p>



<p>Historically, the Suffolk Stars have always played the Rams tough. In their two meetings last season, the teams split the season series as both games were settled by a one-goal margin. This year the Stars (5-6-0) are fighting for a playoff birth, while the Rams have already clinched a bid to the post season. The Fordham offense, despite recent injuries, kicked it up a notch to put together a solid 7-0 victory. Leading the way was Junior transfer Steve Barrett and sophomore Jorge Rocha both netting a pair of goals. Between the pipes, MCHC All Star Joe Wichowski recorded his third shutout of the season turning away 25 shots.</p>

<p>Saturday night's visit to Ingalls Area in New Haven, saw a closer than expected rematch against a stubborn Yale team. However, the Rams prevailed in a 5-minute overtime period to come away with the 4-3 victory. The goalie tandem of Sophomore Dan Callaghan and Freshman Greg Siroky split the game with Siroky coming away with his second win of the season. Four different goals scorers provided the Rams with their offense. Another Steve Barrett goal on an assist from Junior Dave Improta with 16 seconds left in overtime proved to be the difference.</p>

<p>Team notes: Fordham did not score a power play goal in either game this past weekend which is the first time the Rams have failed to score at least one power play goal in consecutive games...Wichowski's third shutout of the season sets a new record for shutouts in a season breaking the record of Vinnie Bocchino set during the 1975-76 season...The Rams only have one game this weekend with a rematch against the Lions from the College of NJ, who handed Fordham a 2-1 loss in December...The Rams are now 13-1 in league play, 16-2 overall.</p>
