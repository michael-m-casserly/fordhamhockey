<div class="NewsArticleTitle">Fordham Captures Division Crown</div>



<div class="NewsArticleAuthor">By Drew Mola / Fordham Hockey Online</div></p>







<p>Feb 06, 2006 -- In what were considered the most important games of the year, the Rams split their weekend matchups against Fairfield and Albany State. Despite the split, the win over Fairfield gave Fordham their first division title since the 1989-90 season, and only the second in team history.</p>



<p>The Fairfield matchup was a hard fought battle with an abnormally high amount of penalty minutes.  The Rams jumped out to an early 3-1 lead after the first period on goals by Steve Barrett, Jorge Rocha, and Derek Kennedy. The Stags (13-2 league, 18-3 overall) cut the lead to one with a breakaway goal by league leading scorer Justin Eisner. But only 15 seconds later the Rams answered back with a Dan Ferraro goal to take the momentum away. The Rams were able to hold off a late charge by Fairfield when with 3 minutes left in the game and Fordham defensemen Mike Masefield in the penalty box, Stags Head Coach Marshall Richards pulled his goalie Bill Dwyer.  Fairfield was able to get a power play goal to cut the lead to one, but that was all. Fordham Goalie Joe Wichowski stopped 35 shots to notch his 16th win of the season.</p>

<p>Since the Fairfield game gave the Rams the division title, Fordham went to Albany on Saturday night for the rights to the MCHC number one seed in the playoffs. Unfortunately, the physical game against Fairfield left the Rams without the services of defenseman Mike Winton and forward Dan Ferraro. Although they played them tough, the Rams weren't able to overcome injuries and a 3-hour bus ride and fell to the Danes by a 5-1 score. The Danes (13-2 league, 17-4 overall) kept constant pressure on the Rams the entire game and despite some offensive flurries by the Rams, were able to keep Fordham in check the entire game. </p>

<p>Team notes: With the end of the regular league season, the team travels to Lancaster Pennsylvania to face off against Delaware Valley College Hockey Conference members Millersville (Friday night) and Franklin &amp; Marshall (Saturday afternoon)...Fordham will have to wait until this weekend to find out who they will face in the first round of the playoffs...The team's 14 league wins and 18 overall wins are the second most in team history...Fordham went undefeated at home is year (11-0) which is the first time in team history this has ever happened...The Rams are now 14-2 in league play, 18-3 overall.</p>
