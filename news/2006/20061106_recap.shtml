<p>Nov 06, 2006 -- Recap from New Paltz and Briarcliffe...</p>



<p><b>vs. New Paltz</b><br>Last Wednesday night saw the team make their annual trip north to Poughkeepsie to face off against SUNY New Paltz. Despite missing a handful of players due to night classes, the Rams were able to come away with a 7-3 victory. The Seahawks kept the game close for 2 periods but a short bench hurt New Paltz as the Rams pulled away in the third. Seven different Rams scored a goal each while Sophomore Greg Siroky stopped 20 shots en route to his first victory of the year.</p>



<p><b>vs. Briarcliffe</b><br>Saturday night's match up saw the team make their first Long Island appearance visiting Briarcliffe College. The teams have faced off 4 previous times in their brief history with Fordham winning all 4 games. The Rams offense scored early and often as they took a 3-0 lead after the first period. The Hawks were stubborn as goalie Tom Nostramo kept them close by turning away 35 Fordham shots. But in the end the Rams were able to fight off two third period 5 on 3 Briarcliffe power plays and hold on for the 5-2 victory. For the second consecutive game, Fordham got scoring from 5 different players. Freshman Mike Barbarula and Conor O'Brien both scored their first ever goals as Rams. In the nets, Joe Wichowski ran his record this year to 6-0 turning way 30 shots.</p>
