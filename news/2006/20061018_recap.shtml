<p>Oct 18, 2006 -- Recaps from the first 3 games of the 2006-07 season...</p>

<p><b>vs. St. Thomas</b><br>Marking the earliest game start in team history, both St. Thomas and Fordham looked sluggish. With the newly enforced changes in USA hockey playing rules, the game saw a total of over 86 minutes in penalties. The Rams took an early 2-0 first period lead on goals by Seniors Jim Bertorelli and John Stachulski. After the teams traded second period goals, the Trojans scored twice within a minute and a half to send the game into a 3-3 tie to start the third period. Fordham responded when on a two man advantage when Junior Matt Pangia scored his second goal of the game as the ams held on for the 4-3 win.</p>

<p><b>vs. CW Post</b><br>The last time Fordham had faced CW Post, the Pioneers were in disarray. They were short on talent as well as bodies as Fordham soundly trashed the by a 17-1 verdict. That was 2 years ago, and in a short time the CW Post program has stepped up the talent level which was not there when the team was still a member of the M.C.H.C. In a game which featured much less penalty minutes and several lead changes, Post has able to squeak by with a 6-5 win. The 3 Ram goalies split a period each, with Sophomore Greg Siroky taking the loss despite stopping 15 shots during the final 20 minutes of the third period. Post played smart hockey allowing the Rams only 1 power play opportunity.</p>

<p><b>vs. St. Rose</b><br>In the team 2006-07 league opener, the Rams traveled up to Albany Academy to face off against a much improved St. Rose program. A member of the MCHC for only 3 years, the two teams did not meet last year and had only met once before during the Knights inaugural season as Fordham, once again, soundly won the game by a 18-4 verdict.</p>

<p>This season St.Rose, who made a nice pre-season showing despite losing to Albany State 8-3, kept the game close through out. Again Fordham jumped out to a 2-0 lead after 1 period on goals by Senior Dan Ferraro and John Stachulski. But St. Rose was resilient tying the game up with 2 quick second period goals. The third period turned out to be the difference as the Rams took advantage of a short Knight bench to put the game out of reach for a 6-3 win. In addition to Ferraro's 2 goals, Senior Steve Barrett netted his first 2 goals of the year while Matt Pangia rounded out the Rams scoring. Senior standout goalie Joe Wichowski collected his first league win (47th of his career) turning away 23 shots.</p>

<p>The St. Rose goalie Aron Eldrige kept the Knights in the game stopping 43 shots.</p>
