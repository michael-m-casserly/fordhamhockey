<div class="NewsArticleTitle">Fordham 4, Suffolk 1</div>



<div class="NewsArticleAuthor">By Drew Mola / Fordham Hockey Online</div></p>



<p>Feb 21, 2006 -- For the fourth consecutive year, the Fordham Rams advanced to the MCHC semi-finals thanks to a solid 4-1 victory over Suffolk Community College.</p>



<p>The Rams stingy defense kept league-leading scorer Kevin Corey in check for most of the game while the Fordham offense just had enough firepower to give the team their small margin of victory.</p>



<p>Fordham struck first on a Dave Improta short-handed goal with only 1:14 left in the first period. The team scored twice in the second period on goals by John Gibbons and a power play goal by Matt Pangia. Suffolk kept it close with a Corey power play goal with 8:18 left in the final period to trim the lead to 3-1 but Junior transfer Steve Barrett buried one past Stars goalie Kristen Johnson with 57 seconds left to seal the Fordham victory.</p>



<p>Team notes: Fordham out shot Suffolk by a 40-29 margin...The Rams allowed Suffolk nine power play chances...Fordham has only given up 9 goals in 110 attempts this entire season, the best power play defense in team history...Fordham is now 19-4 overall, just one victory short of the all time record of 20 set during the 1989-90 season...Junior goalie Joe Wichowski notched his 17th win of the season while lowering his goals against average to a meager 1.89 and bettering his save percentage to 93.2%.</p>
