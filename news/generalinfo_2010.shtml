The team joined the MIHL (Metropolitan Intercollegiate Hockey League), in the fall of 1970 and began playing such teams as Columbia, Fairfield and St. Johns. The team was originally created and funded by Fordham University athletics to become a varsity program. However the team was relegated to its current club status in 1975 when the school chose to elevate it's club football team back to varsity instead. After a league name change to the BSMIHL (Bi-State Metropolitan Intercollegiate Hockey League) for the 1975-76 season, the team held the longest tenure as a member of the MCHC (Metropolitan Collegiate Hockey Conference) after the league changed its name at the start the of the 1976-77 season.</p>

<p>The team is coached by the tandem of Tim Collins and Rich Guberti, both in their third year with the team.

Behind the scenes is team general manager Andrew Mola CBA '86 (27th year) who handles the day-to-day team operations.</p>

Defensively the team posted the league's lowest goals against average along with  an average margin of victory of 5 goals per game.</p>
