<p>September 12, 2012 -- The 2012-2013 season sees the Fordham University ice hockey program now entering its 43rd campaign, one of the longest of any the clubs at school. The team was actually created in the 1967-68 season playing and winning one game versus cross-town rival Manhattan College. The "Maroon Six" as they were known then, began playing a full slate of games during the 1970-71 seasons. The team joined the MIHL (Metropolitan Intercollegiate Hockey League), in the fall of 1970 and began playing such teams as Columbia, Fairfield and St. Johns. The team was originally created and funded by Fordham University athletics to become a varsity program. However the team was relegated to its current club status in 1975 when the school chose to elevate its club football team back to varsity instead. After a league name change to the BSMIHL (Bi-State Metropolitan Intercollegiate Hockey League) for the 1975-76 season, the team held the longest tenure as a member of the MCHC (Metropolitan Collegiate Hockey Conference) after the league changed its name at the start the of the 1976-77 season.</p>

<p>The team is coached by Rich Guberti, in his fifth year with the team. In his three years as the teams Head Coach, Guberti historically ranks 4th in overall wins and 1st in winning percentage.

His Westchester Select tournament teams play in AAA tournaments during the summer on the East Coast.   He has served as Hockey Director of Westchester Mariners since 2004 and has also worked with the Manhattanville Valiants, Sound Shore Warriors as well as other local area organizations.  Over the last 10 years he has won major championships at every youth hockey level.  From Squirts to Midget Majors, his teams have won league titles, attended NYS championships and gone on to Silver Sticks Internationals in both Port Huron Michigan and Toronto Canada. Coach Guberti has placed a number of his players on NCAA college hockey teams and has also seen some continue into the Pro ranks.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes is Director of Hockey Operations, Andrew Mola CBA '86 (29th year) who handles the day-to-day team operations which can range from organizing transportation, finances, alumni relations, statistical analysis, scheduling, recruiting, and running game day operations.

<p>For the 2011-12 season, the teams' success started in early September when they went 4 and 1 in a pre-season tournament in Aston Pennsylvania capturing the tournament championship with a 6-4 victory over Old Dominion.  After completing their 42nd season as members of the Metropolitan Collegiate Hockey Conference, the Rams finished in second place with a 13-3 record but fell short in the post season with a 5-2 loss to SUNY-Maritime in the semi finals.</p>

<p>The team has qualified for the post season for a team record 12 years in row. Overall, the squad posted a winning record of 19-5-1, marking the teams 9th consecutive winning season, the longest in team history. The team 19 wins were also the third most in a single season history.</p>
