<div class="NewsArticleAuthor">By Drew Mola / Fordham Hockey Online</div></p>

<p>June, 2013 -- The 2013-2014 season sees the Fordham University ice hockey program now entering its 44th campaign, one of the longest of any the clubs at school. The team was actually created in the 1967-68 season playing and winning one game versus cross-town rival Manhattan College. The "Maroon Six" as they were known then, began playing a full slate of games during the 1970-71 seasons. The team joined the MIHL (Metropolitan Intercollegiate Hockey League), in the fall of 1970 and began playing such teams as Columbia, Fairfield and St. Johns. The team was originally created and funded by Fordham University athletics to become a varsity program. However the team was relegated to its current club status in 1975 when the school chose to elevate its club football team back to varsity instead. After a league name change to the BSMIHL (Bi-State Metropolitan Intercollegiate Hockey League) for the 1975-76 season, the team held the longest tenure as a member of the MCHC (Metropolitan Collegiate Hockey Conference) after the league changed its name at the start the of the 1976-77 season.</p>

<p>The team is coached by Rich Guberti, in his sixth year with the team. In his four years as the teams Head Coach, Guberti historically ranks 4th in overall wins and 1st   in winning percentage.  Rich has a wealth of coaching experience. A USA Hockey Certified Level 4 Coach, he runs successful year round Power Hockey clinics and Pro Player Summer Camps.  His Westchester Select tournament teams play in AAA tournaments during the summer on the East Coast.   He has served as Hockey Director of Westchester Mariners since 2004 and has also worked with the Manhattanville Valiants, Sound Shore Warriors as well as other local area organizations.  Over the last 11 years he has won major championships at every youth hockey level.  From Squirts to Midget Majors, his teams have won league titles, attended NYS championships and gone on to Silver Sticks Internationals in both Port Huron, Michigan and Toronto, Canada. Coach Guberti has placed a number of his players on NCAA college hockey teams and has also seen some continue into the Pro ranks.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes is Director of Hockey Operations, Andrew Mola CBA '86 (30th year) who handles the day-to-day team operations which can range from organizing transportation, finances, alumni relations, statistical analysis, scheduling, recruiting, and running game day operations. Mola also is in his fifth year serving as the President of the MCHC and has held prior MCHC Executive Board positions such as Director of Eligibility and Director of Structures.</p>

<p>The 2012-13 season came with mixed results. The program played its most competitive schedule to date with several non-league games coming against the American College Hockey Association's Atlantic regions nationally ranking top 10 teams.</p>

<p>After a successful start to the season Hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc not only on the New York area but the Rams season as well. Several games and practices were cancelled and the team was unable to skate for close to a 3 week period. This put a strain on the remainder of the season as many games had to be rescheduled and played on short notice with little game preparation.</p>

<p>The team showed get resiliency in getting the games played and by seasons end the Rams finished in second place for the second consecutive year with a 12-4 record in league play.  The team reached the post season league tournament for the 13th consecutive year but fell short in the semifinal game to SUNY Maritime.  Overall the squad posted a winning record of 14-11, marking the teams 10th consecutive winning season, the longest in team history. Academically, the team maintained a solid 3.2 overall GPA with 5 players awarded with ACHA Academic All-America honors.</p>

<p>The team begins its practices early September skating twice a week until the 16-game league schedule kicks off mid-October. Once the league games start, the practices are scaled back to once a week. No games are played during Thanksgiving break, finals week in December or Christmas break. The season culminates with first round of playoffs in the second weekend of February and the semi finals and finals the third weekend in February. The season is concluded with the annual alumni game, which was reinstated nine years ago after a 5-year absence.</p>
