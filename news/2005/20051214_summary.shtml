<div class="NewsArticleTitle">Fordham Splits Weekend</div>


<div class="NewsArticleAuthor">By Drew Mola / Fordham Hockey Online</div></p>


<p>Dec 14, 2005 -- Upcoming finals, papers, homework and injuries hampered the Rams this past weekend as the team's record setting 9 game winning streak came to an end with a 2-1 lost to non-league opponent College of New Jersey last Saturday night in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. The team was able to regroup the next night with a 5-1 win over MCHC Central Region opponent Southern Connecticut State.</p>


<p>Saturday night's game versus the College of New Jersey Lions was the first ever match up of the two teams (the teams meet again on January 27 at the Ice Hutch). The Lions, an ACHA Division 2 member, played a solid game versus a depleted Fordham squad. The usual potent Fordham offense was shut down by Lions goalie Paul Kelley who turned away 39 shots. The Rams only goal came from Sophomore Jorge Rocha late in the third period. In the nets Junior Joe Wichowski (who suffered only his second loss of the year) played the first 2 periods giving up 1 goal and then was relieved by Sophomore Dan Callaghan who stopped 9 of 10 shots.</p>


<p>Sunday night the Rams traveled to Northford Connecticut to face off against Southern Connecticut State for the teams second meeting of the season. Earlier in the semester the Rams blasted the Owls by a 10-0 "mercy rule", however this game would be much closer. Both teams were pretty evenly matched as Fordham slowly built up to a 3-0 lead before the Owls cut the deficit to 3-1 after the second period. Fortunately, Junior John Stachulski's (2 goals, 2 assists) power play goal 7 minutes into the third period put the game out of reach. Wichowski, again played another solid game for the Rams lowering his goals against average to 1.68 and bettering his save percentage to 93.5%.</p>


<p>Team notes:  Fordham out shot their opponents in both games (College of NJ 40-24 -- Southern Connecticut 50-26)...With every game Goalie Wichowksi plays, Fordham goalie records seem to fall.  With these two weekend games he has passed Rob Whelan (1992-96) for most career games played (60) and John Gillespie (1987-91) for most career minutes (3032)...The teams 12 league wins are the fourth most in team history, the teams 14 overall wins is the fifth most in team history...The Rams have 3 more MCHC games remaining for the second half - all quality opponents (Suffolk, Fairfield, Albany State) as well as 4 non-league games (Yale, College of NJ, Millersville, and Franklin &amp; Marshall)...The Rams are now 12-1 in league play, 14-2 overall.</p>
