<div class="NewsArticleTitle">Fordham Defeats Yale 8-0, Nassau 5-4</div>



<div class="NewsArticleAuthor">By Drew Mola / Fordham Hockey Online</div></p>







<p>Nov 7, 2005 -- Although it wasn't pretty, the Fordham Hockey Rams continued their winning ways this past weekend with victories over Yale and Nassau Community College.</p>



<p>On Friday night, Fordham played host to Yale University in the team's first ever meeting. The Yale club team (3-1) currently plays an independent schedule with a good portion of their games played against MCHC opponents. Even though Fordham won by an 8-0 verdict, defense was the key once again. The Rams only allowed a mere 13 shots on goals as the goalie trio of Junior Joe Wichowski, Sophomore Dan Callaghan and Freshman Greg Siroky gave Fordham its third shutout of the season. Offensively, six different players scored for the Rams, including 2 goals each from Hudson Community College transfer Stephen Barrett and Sophomore Matt Pangia.</p>



<p>Saturday night saw the team jump out to a 5-0 lead against Nassau (1-3). But the Lions chipped away with 4 goals in a 5-minute span to pull within one with 15 minutes left in the game. The team battled against injuries and an abnormal amount of penalties to hold off Nassau for the 5-4 win. Fordham capitalized early on power plays as three of the team's five goals came on power play opportunities, but defensive breakdowns and a hard working Nassau team kept it close. Fortunately, the Rams stepped up in the third period to stop any hopes of a Lions upset.</p>



<p>Team notes:  Fordham has now won its last 4 meetings with Nassau...The Rams allowed Nassau 10 power play opportunities...The team's 20 minutes of penalties were the most accessed in a game this year...Fordham allowed a power play goal for the first time in 6 games and has only has given up 4 power play goals in 46 attempts (9%)...Fordham has two league games on the slate this weekend. On Friday night they play host to C.C.M. (County College of Morris) and on Sunday the Titans return the favor as the Rams head out to Morristown New Jersey to complete the home and home series...The Rams are now 6-1 in league play, 8-1 overall.</p>
