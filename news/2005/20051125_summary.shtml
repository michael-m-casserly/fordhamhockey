<div class="NewsArticleTitle">Fordham 6, Hofstra 4</div>



<div class="NewsArticleAuthor">By Drew Mola / Fordham Hockey Online</div></p>







<p>Nov 25, 2005 -- Up until last Friday night, the Fordham hockey team, thus far, had a successful Fall semester. They have beaten the teams they were supposed to beat. The hardest test for the team came against a proven opponent, the Hofstra Pride. The Fordham-Hofstra rivalry dates back to 1986 and has always been a competitive one. This season Hofstra had just come off a recent  6-4 loss to the number 1 seeded ACHA Atlantic Division University of Pittsburgh Johnstown squad. The Pride is a team who keep a predominate amount of their players from last year's undefeated squad, a squad who just fell short in the MCHC finals against Albany State. In what was a true test for the Rams, Fordham bested the Pride by a 6-4 score.</p>



<p>Hofstra jumped out to the early lead on a Steve Zaffuto goal mid way through the first period. The Rams answered back with the next 5 goals over the course of the next 21 minutes to go ahead to stay. The Rams took a 6-2 led into the locker room to start the third period but Hofstra would not roll over. Two quick goals only 30 seconds apart in the third period kept the Rams on their toes, but they held off any other Pride offensive charge to come away with the victory. It was a true team effort as six different players scored the Rams six goals. The Rams defense played tough when they had to and goalie Joe Wichowski stopped 24 shots in route to his 11 win of the year.</p>


<p>Team notes:  The Hofstra game marked the team's final home game of the semester. The Rams went a perfect 9-0 at home in the Fall...The victory over Hofstra was the team's seventh in a row, which ties the team record for consecutive wins. The winning streak benchmark was originally set during the 1988-89 season (January 22 - February 19, 1989)...Fordham takes a well-earned break for Thanksgiving and then continues their league schedule with visits to Poughkeepsie to play SUNY-New Paltz (0-6) and then to Nanuet to faces off against division rival St. Thomas Aquinas (5-3)...The Rams are now 9-1 in league play, 11-1 overall.</p>
