<p>Oct 7, 2005 -- The Fordham Rams started the 2005-2006 campaign with a successful exhibition win over the Briarcliffe by an 11-1 victory. The Rams and Seahawks played a tight first period with Fordham leading only a 3-1 margin after one period.  However Fordham opened up the second period of play by scoring early and often, netting 5 goals in a 4-minute span. Leading the scoring were junior John Stachulksi (3 goals - 2 assists), sophomore Matt Pangia (2 goals - 2 assists) and Villanova transfer Jorge Rocha (2 goals - 2 assists). When all the dust settled the Rams came away with 35 shots in just 2 periods of play.  Fordham net minder junior Joe Wichowski chalked up his first win of the season stopping 11 of 12 shots, while splitting time with freshman Greg Sirosky and sophomore Dan Callaghan.</p>
