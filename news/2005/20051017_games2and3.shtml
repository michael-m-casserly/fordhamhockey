<p>Oct 17, 2005 -- This past Wednesday night, the Rams faced off with MCHC Central Division rival Columbia in a classic defensive struggle with Fordham coming away with a hard fought 4-1 win. Columbia, coached by former NHL and Russian Red Army defenseman Alexei Kasatonov, played a hard checking game, but the Rams were up to the task. After a scoreless first period, Fordham opened up the scoring with goals midway through the second period as junior Dave Improta and a power play goal from sophomore Matt Pangia put the Rams up by a 2-0 mark. Pangia and junior transfer Stephen Barrett would score in the third period to put the game out of reach. Meanwhile, goalie Joe Wichowski kept the Lions at bay , turning away 31 of 32 shots, allowing a late Columbia score with only 1 minute left in the game.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the team headed to Bridgeport Connecticut's Wonderland of Ice for an afternoon match up with Fairfield. Another hard fought game saw Fordham come away with an impressive 5-2 win against a team that the squad had never beaten. The game featured a lot of penalty minutes by both teams as the Rams grinded and grinded to work for all their goals. Junior Steve Casey opened up the scoring with a goal late in the first period, while sophomore Jorge Rocha got his first goal of the year with less than a minute remaining. By game's end, Rocha - a Villanova transfer - would score two more times to get the hat trick. Defensively the team was absolutely stellar, standing up the Stags who only last season mercy-ruled Fordham at this same rink. In the nets, again Wichowski showed why he is one of the premier MCHC goalies by turning away an astounding 48 shots on goal.</p>
