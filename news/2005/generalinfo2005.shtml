<div class="NewsArticleTitle">Fordham Begins Their 36th Season</div>
<div class="NewsArticleAuthor">By Drew Mola / Fordham Hockey Online</div></p>

<p>Oct 08, 2005 -- The 2005-2006 season sees the Fordham University ice hockey program now entering its 36th campaign, one of the longest of any the clubs at school. The team was actually created in the 1967-68 season playing and winning one game versus cross town rival Manhattan College. The "Maroon Six" as they were known then, began playing a full slate of games during the 1970-71 season. The team joined the MIHL (Metropolitan Intercollegiate Hockey League), in the fall of 1970 and began playing such teams as Columbia, Fairfield and St. Johns. The team was originally created and funded by Fordham University athletics to become a varsity program. However the team was relegated to its current club status in 1975 when the school chose to elevate its club football team back to varsity instead. Since then the team has held the longest tenure in its current league the MCHC (Metropolitan Collegiate Hockey Conference) after the MIHL changed it name during the 1974-75 season.</p>

<p>The team is coached on the ice Jim Soropoulos FC '87, now in his 13th year (the longest tenure of any Fordham hockey coach). Assisting Jim again this season is Mike Zeppieri FC '96 (4th year). Behind the scenes is team general manager Andrew Mola CBA '86 (22nd year) who handles the day-to-day team operations.</p>

<p>The 2004-2005 season saw the team compile their second consecutive winning season, a feat that had not been accomplished in over a decade. The team finished their campaign with a solid fourth place finish in league play with a 9-5-0-2  (16-7-0-2 overall) and qualified for the post-season playoffs for the 10th time in the last 11 years. The team eventually lost in the post-season playoffs but advanced to the semi final game for the third year in a row. The teams 16 wins marked the second most ever in team history and the 25 games played were the most in 15 years. The Rams placed 2 players on the MCHC all-star squad - Senior Rich Siemion and Freshman Matt Pangia while Sophomore transfer John Stachulski was awarded the MCHC sportsmanship award. The most impressive facet of the team is that the average GPA for the squad last semester was an outstanding 3.2. Optimism is high for the squad this year with the graduation of only 4 players, the return of 18 players, and the addition of 11 newcomers.</p>

<p>The team begins its practices early September skating twice a week until the 16 game league schedule kicks off mid-October. Once the league games start, the practices are scaled back to once a week. No games are played during Thanksgiving break, finals week in December or Christmas break. The season culminates with playoffs the third weekend of February. This year the team has already scheduled a number of non-league scrimmages against first time opponents Yale, Franklin & Marshall, College of New Jersey  and Millersville. The season is concluded with the annual alumni game, which was reinstated three years ago year after a 5 years absence.</p>
