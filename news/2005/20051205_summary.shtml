<div class="NewsArticleTitle">Fordham Takes Two</div>







<div class="NewsArticleAuthor">By Drew Mola / Fordham Hockey Online</div></p>















<p>Dec 05, 2005 -- Despite having a week off for Thanksgiving break, the Fordham Rams picked up right where they left off as they won both of their M.C.H.C. contests this week.</p>







<p>Wednesday night saw the team make their annual trip up to Poughkeepsie to face off against SUNY - New Paltz. In spite of the long trip and the absence of some key players because of night time classes, the Rams came away with a 7-1 win. Starting his first collegiate game, Freshman Greg Siroky, after of shaky first, play stellar in the nets turning away 20 Seahawk shots for his first win of the season. A 1-1 score after the first period, Fordham broke the game open scoring the next six goals. The Rams were led by Sophomore Jorge Rocha's hat trick and Junior Jim Bertorelli's 2-goal performance. The fast paced game saw both teams take a combined 8 minutes in penalties.</p>



<p>Friday night the Rams made the short trek over the Tappan Zee Bridge to St. Thomas Aquinas. Earlier in the year the two teams had met with Fordham narrowingly defeating the Trojans by a 4-3 verdict. This meeting would be all together different as the Rams never gave S.T.A.C. a chance to make it close. The Rams opened the scoring 2 minutes into the game with Junior Steve Casey's first of 3 goals on the night. The Rams dominated on offense while taking a 3-0 lead after one period, and a 7-0 lead after two.</p>



<p>Probably the most physical game of the year for Fordham, in most instances the team refused to retaliate to a St. Thomas team which was clearly frustrated by a lack of their own offensive production. In the nets Junior Joe Wichowski notched his 12 win of the season while lowering goals against to 1.75. Eight different players notched at least a goal including 3 coming from the defense.</p>





<p>Team notes:  Fordham outshot both opponents in both games (New Paltz 58-21, St. Thomas 42-21)...The victory over New Paltz breaks the team mark for consecutive wins which stood for 16 years...Fordham continues traveling this weekend with one non-league game and one league game...Saturday night the team travels to Lawrenceville, New Jersey for their first ever meeting with College of New Jersey. On Sunday, Fordham closes out the fall semester when they travel to Northford, Connecticut to take on Southern Connecticut State...Fordham now has a nine game winning streak...The Rams are now 11-1 in league play, 13-1 overall.</p>
