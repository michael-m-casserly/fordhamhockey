<div class="NewsArticleTitle">Fordham Sweeps C.C.M. 8-0, 3-2</div>



<div class="NewsArticleAuthor">By Drew Mola / Fordham Hockey Online</div></p>







<p>Nov 14, 2005 -- It was another successful weekend for the Rams as they took both ends of a home and home series versus C.C.M.</p>



<p>On Friday night, Fordham jumped out with two quick goals by Junior Stephen Barrett (goals within the first minute and a half of the game), chasing Titans starting goalie Brandon Cappiello. C.C.M. backup Steve Crapello fared a little better as he gave up a Matt Pangia goal midway through the first period. Unfortunately, Crapello separated his shoulder with 2:56 left in the period. Cappiello reentered the game but the damage was already done. Fordham would amass a 6-0 lead by the end of the second period, as a stingy Rams defense would allow only 6 shots on goal though 2 periods. When it was all said and done the Rams clearly dominated their opponents again and walked away with an 8-0 victory.  Fordham net minder Junior Joe Wichowski turned away 17 shots in route to his third shutout of the season (the team's fourth overall).</p>



<p>Sunday night's game was more of a battle as Fordham held off a late Titan charge to gain the 3-2 victory. The game was plagued by 26 Fordham minutes in penalties and 8 power play opportunities given to C.C.M. This game was close throughout with a much stronger Titan team coming out to play. Fordham jumped out to a 2-0 lead on goals by Sophomore's Mike Connolly and Matt Pangia but C.C.M answered back with a short-handed goal, the first Fordham has given up all year. Steve Barrett scored his 9th of the year to put the Rams ahead by two, but a late goal with only 5 minutes left in the game kept it close. Fordham neutralized any further Titan scoring and held on to keep sole possession of first place in the M.C.H.C. Central Division.</p>



<p>Team notes:  Wichowski's third shutout ties the mark for individual shutouts in a season, which is also held by Vinnie Bocchino, who accomplished the feat during the 1976-77 season...Fordham power play defense has given up only 5 power play goals in 61 attempts (8%)...Fordham has only one league games on the slate this weekend but it is the biggest game of the year. On Friday night they play host to Hofstra who defeated the Rams in both of their meetings last year on their way to making it all the way the league championship game...The Rams are now 8-1 in league play, 10-1 overall.</p>
