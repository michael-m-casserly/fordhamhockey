<div class="NewsArticleTitle">ACHA Monthly Rankings (Dec. 21)</div>



<div class="NewsArticleAuthor">By Drew Mola / Fordham Hockey Online</div></p>







<p>Dec 21, 2005 -- For the second consecutive ranking period, Fordham was unable to jump back into the top 10 ranks as the Rams held onto their #11 ranking in today's new ACHA Division 3 rankings.</p>



<p>Fordham logged a record of 4-1 for the period of November 14 through December 11 with a "goals for" of 33 and a "goals against" of only 9. It seems apparent that the only way the Rams will be able to crack the top 10 will be to play competitively next semester when they face off against Albany State and Fairfield. The team will have its work cut of for them as they face both of these Top 10 teams on consecutive nights in February.</p>

<p>For those of you unfamiliar with it, the (ACHA) American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) began as a men's collegiate club hockey league in 1992, and quickly grew to a league of over 150 teams in three men's divisions.  The Women's Division was added in 2000, and currently boasts four divisions with over 300 teams from across the nation. Divisions are usually based on school size however over this past summer the MCHC approached the ACHA about waving the student population issue to guarantee entrance in the Division 3 level. An accord was met and now Fordham as well as a predominant numbers of other MCHC teams joined in the newly formed Atlantic conference this year. So now, not only is a league game important, it is now, in most instances consider an ACHA game as well and take on an even greater impact.</p>







<p>The ACHA ranking committee gathers information on the various teams from the four regions Atlantic - North - South - Pacific. Each region is ranked on a monthly basis with the top four ranked teams in each region at the end of February, meeting to play for a national championship. This season the championships will be held in Fort Myers Florida March 1-4.</p>
