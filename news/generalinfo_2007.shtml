<div class="NewsArticleTitle">Fordham Begins Their 38th Season</div>
<div class="NewsArticleAuthor">By Drew Mola / Fordham Hockey Online</div></p>

<p>Oct 3, 2007 -- The 2007-2008 season sees the Fordham University ice hockey program now entering its 38th campaign, one of the longest of any the clubs at school. The team was actually created in the 1967-68 season playing and winning one game versus cross town rival Manhattan College. The "Maroon Six" as they were known then, began playing a full slate of games during the 1970-71 season. The team joined the MIHL (Metropolitan Intercollegiate Hockey League), in the fall of 1970 and began playing such teams as Columbia, Fairfield and St. Johns. The team was originally created and funded by Fordham University athletics to become a varsity program. However the team was relegated to its current club status in 1975 when the school chose to elevate its club football team back to varsity instead. After a league name change to the BSMIHL (Bi-State Metropolitan Intercollegiate Hockey League) for the 1975-76 season, the team held the longest tenure as a member of the MCHC (Metropolitan Collegiate Hockey Conference) after the league changed its name at the start the of the 1976-77 season.</p>

<p>The team is coached by former Ram standout Chip Foley FC '96 (2nd year). Behind the scenes is team general manager Andrew Mola CBA '86 (24th year) who handles the day-to-day team operations.</p>

<p>Last season marked the another successful campaign put together by the Rams. The team's 13-5-1 overall record marked the fourth winning season in a row, a first in team history and by seasons end, the team was ranked #11 in the ACHA Division III Atlantic Region. During the year Fordham also competed in the first ever College Hockey East (C.H.E.) vs. M.C.H.C. Showdown where they split their two game series, defeating #13 ranked University of Pittsburgh-Johnson 7-2 but losing to #3 ranked Indiana University of Pennsylvania 4-3.</p>

<p>During the regular season, the team finished second in the MCHC North Region. On a national level, playing for only their second year as a member of the American Collegiate Hockey Association, the team placed eight students on the Academic All-American team, the most of any ACHA Division III program. Being student athletes first, the team is equally proud of the fact they carried a cumulative GPA of 3.25 for the spring semester with 80% of the team carrying a B average or better. With the loss of 10 seniors to graduation (whose impact had brought a combined 4 year record of 63-25-1) it will be interesting to see if those returning players and new additions to the squad can follow in the footsteps of their predecessors winning ways.</p>

<p>The team begins its practices early September skating twice a week until the 16 game league schedule kicks off mid-October. Once the league games start, the practices are scaled back to once a week. No games are played during Thanksgiving break, finals week in December or Christmas break. The season culminates with first round of playoffs in the final weekend of February and the semi finals and finals the first weekend in March . The season is concluded with the annual alumni game, which was reinstated four years ago after a 5-year absence.</p>
