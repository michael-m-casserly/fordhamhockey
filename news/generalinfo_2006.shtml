<div class="NewsArticleTitle">Fordham Begins Their 37th Season</div>
<div class="NewsArticleAuthor">By Drew Mola / Fordham Hockey Online</div></p>

<p>Oct 10, 2006 -- The 2006-2007 season sees the Fordham University ice hockey program now entering its 37th campaign, one of the longest of any the clubs at school. The team was actually created in the 1967-68 season playing and winning one game versus cross town rival Manhattan College. The "Maroon Six" as they were known then, began playing a full slate of games during the 1970-71 season. The team joined the MIHL (Metropolitan Intercollegiate Hockey League), in the fall of 1970 and began playing such teams as Columbia, Fairfield and St. Johns. The team was originally created and funded by Fordham University athletics to become a varsity program. However the team was relegated to its current club status in 1975 when the school chose to elevate its club football team back to varsity instead. After a league name change to the BSMIHL (Bi-State Metropolitan Intercollegiate Hockey League) for the 1975-76 season, the team held the longest tenure as a member of the MCHC (Metropolitan Collegiate Hockey Conference) after the league changed its name at the start the of the 1976-77 season.</p>

<p>This season the team will be coached by former Ram standout Chip Foley FC '96. Behind the scenes is team general manager Andrew Mola CBA '86 (23rd year) who handles the day-to-day team operations.</p>

<p>Last season marked the high watermark in the history of the Fordham University Hockey program. During the course of the year the team accomplished many things. They captured only our second division crown in the team's history as well as set a team record with 21 wins to only 4 losses. But capturing the Central Division title in the Metropolitan Collegiate Hockey Conference was not enough.</p>

<p>After advancing to the league semi final game for the fourth time in the last four years, the team defeated Hofstra 8-5 in the semi final game and on Sunday February 26, 2006 defeated SUNY-Albany State in overtime by a 3-2 margin to win their first league championship. The sweetness of winning a league championship pales in comparison to the way they got there. The team played through many difficulties but even though they lost a number of players to season-ending injuries, every individual stepped up to give an entire team effort. By season's end Fordham had placed 3 players on the league all star team, including Goalie Joe Wichowski who led the entire league in wins, save percentage and goals against average and was named as not only playoff MVP but league MVP as well. On a national level, playing for the first time as a member of the American Collegiate Hockey Association, the Fordham program was ranked 9th best in the Atlantic region. Being student athletes first,  the team is equally proud of the fact they carried a cumulative GPA of 3.2 for the fall semester with 70% of the team carrying a B average or better. With the loss of only 2 seniors to graduation, we are looking forward to another exciting and successful season this fall.</p>

<p>The team begins its practices early September skating twice a week until the 16 game league schedule kicks off mid-October. Once the league games start, the practices are scaled back to once a week. No games are played during Thanksgiving break, finals week in December or Christmas break. The season culminates with playoffs the third weekend of February. This year the team agreed to participate in the first ever MCHC vs. CHE (College Hockey East) Showdown which features nationally ranked  ACHA opponents University of Pittsburgh - Johnstown and Indiana University of Pennsylvania . The season is concluded with the annual alumni game, which was reinstated three years ago after a 5-year absence.</p>
