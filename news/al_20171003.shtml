<p>October 3, 2017</p>

<p>Dear Fellow Alumni,</p>

<p>Former Ram John Quigg (Class of 2013) was in a recent diving accident were he suffered paralysis.</p>
 
<p>The former Chaminade HS graduate and East Williston Long Island native was one of the most colorful players I have ever run across during my 34 years with the team.</p>
 
<p>I am asking the Fordham Hockey community to reach out and do whatever they can to support John and his family.</p>
